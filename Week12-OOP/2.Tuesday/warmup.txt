Instructions:

    Create a Class:
        Create a class named Person.
        This class should have three private fields: name (String), age (int), and email (String).

    Generate Constructor:
        Create a constructor that initializes all three fields.

    Implement Getter and Setter Methods:
        Create public getter and setter methods for each of the private fields.

    Add Validation in Setters:
        Add basic validation in the setter methods:
            setName should not accept null or empty strings.
            setAge should not accept negative values.
            setEmail should not accept null or empty strings and should contain an @ character.

    Test the Class:

         Write a main method to test the Person class. Create an instance of Person and demonstrate the use of getter and setter methods, including the validation logic.

    HINT - Java allows us to throw exceptions when we want. 
           For example throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be a negative value") would be the syntax.
